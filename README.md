# CS52 Workshops:  Map APIs: Google Maps, Leaflet and Mapbox

![](./img/lookingMap.gif)

Maps are everywhere :rainbow: We'd be lost without the maps on our phone, and apps from Uber to Snapchat wouldn't work without the capabilities of these APIs. Map APIs can give routing and time estimation, produce cool data visualizations and construct augmented reality. The best part is, it's pretty easy for us to take advantage of all their cool features too :smiley_cat: ** more pros ** 

## Overview

We're going to be writing a react component that utilizes the Google Maps API. First, we're going to learn how to add a map to a react component. Then, we're going to drop personalized points on our map. Next, we're going to create a heat map data visualization based on our points!

## Setup

Clone the workshop repository and then run /*and use code blocks for any code!*/. We need to install all the dependencies from the package.json file. Then run /*yarn start*/ to make sure everything's looking good :sunglasses:

The next step is to install the google maps react library so we can use google maps within our react app! We do this by running /*yarn add google-maps-react*/

Since we're using an API, we need to fetch an API key, just like we did for the Youtube API in Short Assignment 4. To do this you should head to http://console.developers.google.com

1. Select **Credentials** on the lefthand, invisable menu and you should see a screen like this.

2. Go ahead and copy the API because we'll need it in a bit (it's the same one you used for the Youtube API! Google is everywhere :scream:)


## Step by Step

* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices

Remember to explain any notation you are using.

```javascript
/* and use code blocks for any code! */
```

## Reflection

:bulb: Remember to submit these on canvas!

* [ ] 2 reflection questions
* [ ] Can you think of any instances where you would use a map API in a web or mobile app? For one of those examples, which API (Leaflet, Mapbox, Google Maps) would you choose and why?
